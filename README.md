# Bafwiz: Modpack
An auto-updating, but otherwise pretty boring modpack for Minecraft 1.18.2

This pack is intended to be imported as a **.zip** archive into the [PolyMC](https://github.com/PolyMC/PolyMC) launcher, but I suppose if you are familiar with packwiz you can probably use it on anything.

Feel free to fork or modify anything here, and I'm open to hearing out any mod suggestions anyone might have. 

**None** of these mods are my own. I'm not smart enough for that. They're all just ones that I really like!
